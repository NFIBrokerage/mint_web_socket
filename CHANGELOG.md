## UNRELEASED

This release is a breaking change from the 0.1.0 series. This update removes
all instances where Mint.WebSocket would access opaque `t:Mint.HTTP.t/0` fields
or call private functions within `Mint.HTTP1`, so now Mint.WebSocket should be
more compatible with future changes to Mint.

#### Upgrade guide

First, add the `scheme` argument to calls to `Mint.WebSocket.upgrade/5`.
For connections formed with `Mint.HTTP.connect(:http, ..)`, use the `:ws`
scheme. For `Mint.HTTP.connect(:https, ..)`, use `:wss`.


```diff
- Mint.WebSocket.upgrade(conn, path, headers)
+ Mint.WebSocket.upgrade(scheme, conn, path, headers)
```

Then replace calls to `Mint.HTTP.stream/2` and/or `Mint.HTTP.recv/3` and
`Mint.HTTP.stream_request_body/3` with the new `Mint.WebSocket` wrappers.
This is safe to do even when these functions are being used to send and
receive data in normal HTTP requests: the functionality only changes when
the connection is an established HTTP/1 WebSocket.

### Added

- Added `Mint.WebSocket.stream/2` which wraps `Mint.HTTP.stream/2`
- Added `Mint.WebSocket.recv/3` which wraps `Mint.HTTP.recv/3`
- Added `Mint.WebSocket.stream_request_body/3` which wraps `Mint.HTTP.stream_request_body/3`

### Changed

- Changed function signature of `Mint.Websocket.upgrade/5` to accept the
  WebSocket's scheme (`:ws` or `:wss`) as the first argument
- Added an optional `opts` argument to `Mint.WebSocket.new/5` to control
  active vs. passive mode on the socket
- Restricted compatible Mint versions to `~> 1.4`
    - `Mint.WebSocket` now uses `Mint.HTTP.get_protocol/1` which was
      introduced in `1.4.0`.
